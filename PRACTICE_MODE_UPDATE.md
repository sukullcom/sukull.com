- ❌ +1 heart for correct answers (REMOVED)
- ❌ -1 heart for wrong answers

**First Time (normal mode):**

## New Behavior
**Practice Mode (when lesson completed once):**
- ✅ +20 points for correct answers
- ❌ -1 heart for wrong answers  
- ❌ No hearts earned

**First Time (normal mode):**
- ✅ +10 points for correct answers

## Technical Implementation
Updated the Quiz component logic in `app/lesson/quiz.tsx`:

```javascript
// Before:
if (initialPercentage === 100) {
  setHearts((prev) => Math.min(prev + 1, 5));  // Removed this line
  setPoints((prev) => prev + 20);
}

// After:
if (initialPercentage === 100) {
  // Practice mode: only award points, no hearts
  setPoints((prev) => prev + 20);
}
```

## Purpose
Practice mode is now purely for:
- **Skill improvement** - Get 20 points for practicing
- **Knowledge reinforcement** - No heart farming
- **Challenge mastery** - Focus on learning, not resource recovery

Hearts can only be gained through:
- 💰 **Shop purchases**
- ⏰ **Time-based regeneration** 
- 🎁 **Special rewards**

This ensures practice mode focuses on learning rather than resource management! 🎯
