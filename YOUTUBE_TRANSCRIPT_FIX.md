# YouTube Transcript API Fix - Production Issue Resolved

## Problem Description
The SubScribe game was returning a 500 error when trying to fetch YouTube transcripts in production:
```
/api/youtube-transcript?videoId=BGqkY-i0ZHU&lang=en:1  Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 ()
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by trying to run `yt-dlp` binary on **Vercel's serverless platform**, which has the following limitations:
- No binary execution allowed
- Limited file system access 
- Cannot download and install external binaries like `yt-dlp`

The `ytdlp-nodejs` package works fine in local development but fails in Vercel's restricted serverless environment.

## Solution Implemented
Moved the YouTube transcript API from Vercel to **Railway server** where binary execution is allowed.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Added YouTube Transcript Endpoint to Railway Server
- **File**: `payment-server.js`
- **Added**: Complete YouTube transcript API implementation using `ytdlp-nodejs`
- **Features**: 
  - Full transcript extraction with multiple format support (json3, vtt, srv1, ttml)
  - Language fallback system
  - Automatic and manual subtitle support
  - Proper error handling

#### 2. Updated Frontend to Use Railway Server
- **Files Updated**: 
  - `app/(main)/(protected)/games/SubScribe/page.tsx`
  - `app/(main)/(protected)/games/SubScribe/game/page.tsx`
- **Change**: API calls now use `${paymentServerUrl}/api/youtube-transcript` instead of `/api/youtube-transcript`

#### 3. Removed Non-Working Vercel API Route
- **Deleted**: `app/api/youtube-transcript/route.ts`
- **Reason**: This route doesn't work in production due to Vercel limitations

### Technical Details

#### Railway Server Implementation
```javascript
// YouTube Transcript API endpoint
app.get('/api/youtube-transcript', async (req, res) => {
  // Full implementation with yt-dlp binary support
  // Supports multiple subtitle formats and languages
  // Robust error handling and fallback system
});
```

#### Frontend API Call Update
```javascript
const paymentServerUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENT_SERVER_URL || 'https://sukullcom-production.up.railway.app';
const transcriptResponse = await fetch(`${paymentServerUrl}/api/youtube-transcript?videoId=${videoId}&lang=en`);
```

## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Railway Server Deployment
The `ytdlp-nodejs` package is already in `package.json`, so Railway will automatically install it during deployment.

### 2. Environment Variables
Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENT_SERVER_URL` is set in Vercel environment variables:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYMENT_SERVER_URL=https://your-railway-app.railway.app
```

### 3. Deploy Both Services
1. **Railway**: Push changes to trigger automatic Railway deployment
2. **Vercel**: Push changes to trigger Vercel frontend deployment

## Testing
1. Go to SubScribe game
2. Paste a YouTube URL with transcript
3. Click "Oyuna Ba≈üla"
4. Should now work without 500 errors

## Why This Solution Works
- **Railway**: Full Linux environment with binary execution support
- **Vercel**: Handles frontend and other API routes that don't need binaries
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Best of both platforms - Vercel for fast frontend, Railway for binary-dependent APIs

## Future Considerations
If you need more binary-dependent APIs, consider:
1. Moving them to Railway server
2. Using Railway for all backend APIs
3. Keeping Vercel only for frontend deployment

This fix ensures the SubScribe game works reliably in production while maintaining optimal performance.
