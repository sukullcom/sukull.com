# Email Verification Setup Guide

## Overview

The email verification system is now fully implemented and configured. When users create accounts, they will receive verification emails that they must click to activate their accounts.

## ✅ Current Implementation

### 1. Email Verification Flow

1. **User Registration**: User fills out the signup form with username, email, and password
2. **Account Creation**: System creates Supabase auth user with email confirmation required
3. **Email Sent**: Supabase automatically sends verification email to user
4. **User Clicks Link**: User clicks verification link in email
5. **Verification**: Link redirects to `/callback` which processes the verification
6. **Success**: User is redirected to login page with success message

### 2. Key Features

- ✅ **Automatic email sending** on account creation
- ✅ **Email confirmation required** before login
- ✅ **Success notifications** when email is verified
- ✅ **Resend verification email** functionality
- ✅ **Proper error handling** for unverified accounts
- ✅ **Username preservation** during verification process

### 3. Enhanced Components

#### Auth System (`utils/auth.ts`)
- `signUp()`: Creates account with email confirmation
- `resendVerificationEmail()`: Allows users to request new verification emails
- Enhanced logging for debugging

#### Callback Handler (`app/api/auth/callback/route.ts`)
- Handles both OAuth and email verification
- Preserves username from metadata
- Redirects to appropriate pages based on verification type

#### Login Form (`app/(auth)/login/login-form.tsx`)
- Shows success message when user arrives after verification
- Includes link to resend verification emails

#### New Resend Verification Page (`app/(auth)/resend-verification/`)
- Dedicated page for users to request new verification emails
- User-friendly interface with clear instructions

## 🔧 Supabase Configuration Required

To ensure email verification works properly, verify these settings in your Supabase dashboard:

### 1. Email Settings
Go to **Authentication > Settings > Email**:

- ✅ **Confirm email**: Should be **ENABLED**
- ✅ **Enable email confirmations**: Should be **ENABLED**

### 2. URL Configuration
Go to **Authentication > Settings > URL Configuration**:

- **Site URL**: `https://sukull.com` (production) or `http://localhost:3000` (development)
- **Redirect URLs**: 
  - `https://sukull.com/callback`
  - `http://localhost:3000/callback`

### 3. Email Templates (Optional)
Go to **Authentication > Email Templates**:

You can customize the verification email template to match your branding.

## 🧪 Testing Email Verification

### 1. Local Testing

1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to `/create-account`
3. Create a new account with a real email address
4. Check your email (including spam folder)
5. Click the verification link
6. Verify you're redirected to login with success message

### 2. Production Testing

1. Deploy your application
2. Update Supabase URLs to production URLs
3. Test the same flow with real email addresses

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Email Not Received

1. **Check Spam Folder**: Verification emails often end up in spam
2. **Resend Email**: Use the "Yeniden Gönder" link on the login page
3. **Check Supabase Logs**: Go to Authentication > Users in Supabase dashboard
4. **Verify Configuration**: Ensure email confirmation is enabled in Supabase

### Verification Link Not Working

1. **Check URLs**: Ensure redirect URLs are correctly configured
2. **Check Console**: Look for errors in browser console
3. **Check Network**: Verify the callback route is accessible

### User Not Appearing in Database

1. **Check Callback Route**: Ensure `/api/auth/callback` is working
2. **Check User Creation**: Look at `users.captureUserDetails()` function
3. **Check Database**: Verify user record is created after verification

## 📝 Available Routes

- `/create-account` - User registration
- `/login` - User login (shows verification success)
- `/resend-verification` - Request new verification email
- `/callback` - Handles email verification (automatic)

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** with real email addresses
2. **Customize email templates** in Supabase (optional)
3. **Monitor verification rates** in Supabase analytics
4. **Consider adding phone verification** for additional security (future enhancement)

## 💡 Tips

- Always test with real email addresses, not temporary ones
- Monitor your Supabase email quota if you have high volume
- Consider implementing email rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Keep verification links simple and clear in emails

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Email verification prevents unauthorized access to accounts
- Users cannot login until they verify their email
- Verification links expire after a set time (configurable in Supabase)
- The system prevents multiple accounts with the same email
